    "## Summary\n",
    "HANK adds to the existing distributional macroeconomic tools and aims to contribute a more empirically accurate model of monetary policy transmissions through household consumption. This contributes to both the academic landscape and potential policy tools to help identify the most effective fiscal and monetary policy response to economic shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Existing representative agent frameworks and the results they output for measuring the effects of monetary policy are inconsistent with empirical evidence. These existing models adopt an 'approximate aggregation' approach to modelling households where rich individuals are scaled versions of poor individuals (Krusell and Smith 1998; Young 2005). As a result, households face permanent income and Ricardian equivalence holds. This means the direct effects of monetary policy from intertemporal substitution account for over 95 per cent of the effect of monetary policy. However, the paper points to three key facts from US consumer data that suggest these results warrant scepticism: \n",
    "1. there is limited evidence of a strong consumption response to interest rate changes, instead \n",
    "2. consumers respond more strongly to transitory income changes where individuals have a much higher MPC than implied in these models, and \n",
    "3. the heterogeneity in consumer sensitivities to interest rate and income changes are largely driven by the condition of their household balance sheets. \n",
    "\n",
    "HANK aims to improve the microfoundations of existing models by bringing in micro data to empirically discipline macroeconomic theories around monetary policy transmission mechanisms (Achdou et al. 2022). The authors build a rich household sector that captures the heterogeneity in wealth and MPC distributions to endogenously build consumer behaviour that is empirically consistent with the three facts mentioned previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "This richer model framework allows monetary and fiscal policy makers insight into the winners and losers of policy decisions, and reassess the roll of both. HANK captures the fact that the impact of monetary policy depends on factors that are more out of control of central banks that existing models. The model's constrained household framework breaks Ricardian equivalence meaning the actions of fiscal policy can have significant impacts on the aggregate impact of monetary policy. This highlights to importance of coordination between fiscal and monetary policy makers.\n"

    "## Model Approach\n",
    "The HANK model is born from the marriage of traditional New Keynesian models and Bewley models. The model takes the traditional New Keynesian model and replaces the IS curve with a richer household sector that better reflects the empirically founded theory of consumer behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Household sector\n",
    "\n",
    "Households in HANK consume and supply labour, and face two key margins: (1) to consume or save in liquid assets and (2) the portfolio choice between liquid and illiquid assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The household sector is set up to endogenise an empirically realistic distribution of marginal propensities consume (MPC) and household wealth. This is achieved through two channels: (1) idiosyncratic labour productivity ($z$) and (2) allow households to hold varying portfolios of liquid ($a$) and illiquid ($b$) assets. Endogenizing these characteristics produces three types of households in the model: \n",
    "- classic 'wealthy' households that holds both liquid and illiquid wealth \n",
    "- poor 'hand-to-mouth' households that hold no liquid or illiquid wealth\n",
    "- wealthy 'hand-to-mouth' households that hold no liquid wealth but a lot of illiquid wealth \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'hand-to-mouth' households account for around 30 per cent of the total population and introduce constraints that mean Ricardian equivalence holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each time period $t$ the state of the economy is determined by the joint distribution $\\mu_t (da, db, dz)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "HANK captures death through an exogenous Poisson intensity $\\zeta$ where at the end of the lifecycle, all wealth is distributed to other individuals in the economy proportionate to their existing asset holdings. The individual is replaced with a new, zero wealth, individual with randomly drawn labour productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Household utility\n",
    "\n",
    "A representative household consumes and supplies labour with preferences over utility from consumption ($c_t \\geq 0$) and disutility from working ($\\mathscr{l}_t \\in [0,1]$). Utility $u$ is strictly increasing and concave in consumption and strictly decreasing and concave in hours worked. Preferences are conditional on an individual surviving ($\\zeta$) where the future is discounted at rate $\\rho \\geq 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_0 \\int_{0}^\\infty e^{-(\\rho + \\zeta)t} u_(c_t, \\mathscr{l}_t)dt\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Households maximise their expected utility subject to a number of budget constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Household budget constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Household asset holdings and their second marginal choice between liquid and illiquid assets evolve according to three key functions: (1) liquid assets, (2) kinked transaction cost function and (3) illiquid assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Budget constraint 1: Savings in liquid assets $\\dot{b}_t$**\n",
    "\n",
    "Households can borrow in liquid assets up to some exogenous limit at the real interest rate $r^{-b}_t = r^b_t + \\kappa$ where $\\kappa>0$ represents an exogenous wedge between borrowing and lending rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{b}_t$ increases with household income from labour, investments and government benefits and falls with household income diverted towards investments and consumption expenditure. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\dot{b}_t = (1 - \\tau_t)w_t z_t \\mathscr{l}_t + r^b_t(b_t) b_t + T_t - d_t - \\chi (d_t, a_t) - c_t\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- the first term equals the income from labour $w_t$ less income tax $\\tau_t$. Wages are also adjusted for the household's idiosyncratic labour productivity $z_t$ and their preference for leisure (i.e. disutility of working) $\\mathscr{l}_t$. \n",
    "- the second term captures interest earnings on liquid assets \n",
    "- $T_t$ represents government transfers/payments\n",
    "- $d_t$ is the money directed to illiquid account $\\dot{a}_t$\n",
    "- $\\chi(d_t, a_t)$ represents a kinked transaction cost function with functional form $\\chi_t|d| + \\chi_1|\\frac{d}{a}|^{x_2}a$ which ensure that costs jump discontinuously to strictly positive numbers thereby creating inaction in households\n",
    "- $c_t$ is the household's consumption expenditure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Budget constraint 2: Net savings in illiquid assets $\\dot{a}_t$**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{a}_t$ is calculated as interest earned from assets plus the net deposit from the household's liquid account $\\dot{b}_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    " \\dot{a}_t = r^a_t a_t + d_t \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $r^a_t$ is the return on illiquid assets where in equilibrium, as a result of the transaction cost, is always greater than the real return on liquid assets where $r^b_t > r^b_t$\n",
    "- $a_t$ is the level of illiquid assets \n",
    "- $d_t$ is hte money directed to illiquid assets from a household's liquid account\n",
    "\n",
    "Households can invest illiquid savings into capital $k_t$ and equity shares of intermediate firms that give a claim to the future stream of monopoly profits net price adjustment costs. There is no cost to households for shifting between these two assets so a no-arbitrage condition holds such that the return on equity equals the return on capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Household recursive problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steady state, the household recursive solution consists of decision rules for consumption, deposits and labour supply that determine optimal levels of liquid and illiquid assets:\n",
    "- consumption $c(a, b, z; \\Gamma)$\n",
    "- deposits $d(a, b, z; \\Gamma)$\n",
    "- labour supply $\\mathscr{l}(a, b, z; \\Gamma)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Gamma:= (r^b, r^a, w, \\tau, T)$\n",
    "\n",
    "These optimal levels of liquid and illiquid assets together with the stochastic labour productivity process for $z$ induce a stationary joint distribution for illiquid assets, liquid assets and labour income $\\mu(da, db, dz; \\Gamma)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hand-to-mouth households \n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of the kinked price adjustment cost, the asset structure, the wedge between borrowing an saving and the labour income risks introduced above allow for a cohort of constrained households. These 'hand-to-mouth' households give way to a more realistic distribution of wealth and MPC in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Producers\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses the traditional New Keynesian structure with Final-Goods producers aggregating a continuum of inputs produced by Intermediate Goods producers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intermediate Goods Producers\n",
    "Monopolistically competitive firms produce intermediate good $j$ by renting capital inputs $k_{j, t}$ at rate $r^k_t$ and labour $n_{j, t}$ at wage $w$ from households using the production function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y_{j, t} = k^\\alpha_{j, t} n^{1-\\alpha}_{j, t}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms cost minimise and face the same marginal cost where factor prices equal their marginal revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firms choose prices $\\{p_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}$ to maximise profits subject to a quadratic adjustment cost function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-\\int_0^t r^a_s ds} \\Big\\{\\tilde{\\Pi}_t (p_t) - \\Theta_t \\frac{\\dot{p_t}}{p_t} \\Big\\} dt\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\tilde{\\Pi}_t (p_t) = (\\frac{p_t}{P_t} - m_t)(\\frac{p_t}{P_t})^{- \\epsilon}Yt$ represents profits prior to price adjustment costs\n",
    "- $\\Theta_t \\frac{\\dot{p_t}}{p_t} = \\frac{\\theta}{2} (\\frac{\\dot{p_t}}{p_t})^2Yt$ is the quadratic Rotemburg cost of price adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final-Goods producers\n",
    "A competitive representative final-goods producer aggregates a intermediate inputs indexed by $j \\in [0.1]$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Y_t = \\Big(\\int_{0}^1 y_{j,t}^{\\frac{\\epsilon - 1}{\\epsilon}} dj \\Big)^{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon - 1}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Government sector\n",
    "\n",
    "The government sector faces exogenously determined expenditure $(G_t)$ and administers taxes $(\\tau_t)$ and transfers $(T_t)$ on household labour income $w_tz\\mathscr{l}_t$. Revenue is also raised through bonds $(B_t^g)$. Outside of the steady state, the fiscal instruments that Government can use to adjust and balance the budget include: $\\tau_t, T_t,$ and $G_t$. Given Ricardian equivalence no longer holds under constrained households, the choice of fiscal instrument can have significant implications for transmission mechanisms and size of impact from monetary policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monetary authority\n",
    "\n",
    "HANK assumes the monetary authority determines the real interest $r^b_t$  rate by setting the nominal interest rate $i_t$ on liquid assets according to the Taylor rule, consistent with the Fisher equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "i_t = \\bar{r}^b + \\phi \\pi_t + \\epsilon_t\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "    1. heterogenous agents\n",
    "    2. Two types of intertemporal assets, one of which is illiquid\n",

    "**Issues & questions raised in the paper**\n",
    "- The drive of this paper is to trace the impact of the interest rate to household consumption\n",
    "- In typical NKM (RANK), the interest rate changes intertemporal substitution.\n",
    "\t- The impacts are traced entirely through the Euler equation of the representative household\n",
    "\t- However, the strong effect doesn't line up with empirical observation\n",
    "\t- The is partly due to households having low liquidity and high borrowing rates, and therefore at a 'kink' in their budget set.\n",
    "- The empirical evidence shows the quarterly marginal propensity to consume of 25 per cent from government transfers with a high degree of heterogeneity.\n",
    "- This builds their case that the RANK model needs more heterogeneity since it doesn't match observed behaviours\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features of the model**\n",
    "- Builds on the \"standard\" Aiyagari-Huggett-Imrohoroglu incomplete markets model but adds two assets for saving.\n",
    "\t- Is consistent with liquid and illiquid wealth\n",
    "\t- Allows the sizable MPC\n",
    "\t- Supply side prices are set by monopolistic competitive producers who face nominal rigidities\n",
    "\t- Monetary policy follows a Taylor rule.\n",
    "\t- Solved in continuous time rather than discrete time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results of the paper**\n",
    "- In contrast with RANK models, the impact of the direct effects (making intertemporal substitution more/less expensive) are small, while the indirect effects through the labour market are large.\n",
    "- The combination of uninsurable risk along with illiquid assets results in a large proportion of both wealthy and poor households that live hand-to-mouth as in the empirical data.\n",
    "- A second result is that monetary and fiscal sides are intertwined since the government is the major issuer of liquid obligations. A change in interest rates therefore generates some form of fiscal response. This results in a breakdown in Ricardian equivalence.\n",
    "- Policy results:\n",
    "\t- Monetary authorities can pick between large and transitory interest rate shocks, and small and persistent interest rate hikes. In RANK models, these are the same. In a HANK model, a large hard shock is more effective.\n",
    "\t- In the HANK model, if government absorb the change in interest rates it assists the monetary authority in its goals.\n",
    "- In the RANK model, it is easier for the monetary authority to booth aggregate consumption. In a HANK model, it is more difficult to target"
