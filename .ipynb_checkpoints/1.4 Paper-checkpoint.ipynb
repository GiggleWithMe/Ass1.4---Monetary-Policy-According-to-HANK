    "## Summary\n",
    "HANK adds to the existing distributional macroeconomic tools and aims to contribute a more empirically accurate model of monetary policy transmissions through household consumption. This contributes to both the academic landscape and potential policy tools to help identify the most effective fiscal and monetary policy response to economic shocks. It fundamentally aims to compare against the real world and other models, rather than build itself as progress in the world of micro-founded general equilibrium models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing representative agent New-Keynesian frameworks and the results they output for measuring the effects of monetary policy are inconsistent with empirical evidence. These existing models adopt an 'approximate aggregation' approach to modelling households where rich individuals are scaled versions of poor individuals (Krusell and Smith 1998; Young 2005). As a result, households face permanent income and Ricardian equivalence holds. This means the direct effects of monetary policy from intertemporal substitution account for almost all — over 95 per cent — of the effect of monetary policy. However, the paper points to three key facts from US consumer data that suggest these results warrant scepticism: \n",
    "1. there is limited evidence of a strong consumption response to interest rate changes, instead \n",
    "2. consumers respond more strongly to transitory income changes where individuals have a much higher MPC than implied in these models, and \n",
    "3. the heterogeneity in consumer sensitivities to interest rate and income changes are largely driven by the condition of their household balance sheets. \n",
    "\n",
    "HANK aims to propose a mechanism to explain this shortfall in existing models by bringing in data to empirically discipline macroeconomic theories around monetary policy transmission mechanisms (Achdou et al. 2022). The authors build a rich household sector that captures the heterogeneity in wealth and MPC distributions to endogenously build consumer behaviour that is empirically consistent with the three facts mentioned previously. Specifically it adds heterogenous agents, charactiserized by two types of intertemporal assets — one of which is illiquid and is costly to access as a result of monetary shocks (and idiosyncratic wealth earning potential). Without heterogenous agents — and a mechanism which makes them distinct — it is impossible to consider wealth effects. In this regard, HANK builds on the \"standard\" Aiyagari-Huggett-Imrohoroglu incomplete markets model but adds two classes of assets for saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "This richer model framework allows monetary and fiscal policy makers insight into the winners and losers of policy decisions, and reassess the roll of both. HANK captures the fact that the impact of monetary policy depends on factors that are more out of control of central banks that existing models. The model's constrained household framework breaks Ricardian equivalence meaning the actions of fiscal policy can have significant impacts on the aggregate impact of monetary policy. This highlights to importance of coordination between fiscal and monetary policy makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results of the paper\n",
    "In contrast with representative agent (RANK) models, the impact of the direct effects (making intertemporal substitution more or less expensive) are small, while the indirect effects through the labour market are large. In the HANK model, the indirect components account for 80% of the consumption response, while the direct component only accounts for 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key  insight into the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in HANK is that the type of fiscal adjustment following the monetary shock matters for aggregate consumption response. This means that the fiscal policy response is much more important in HANK to the effectiveness of monetary policy."

    "## Model Approach\n",
    "The HANK model is born from the marriage of traditional New Keynesian models and Bewley models. The model takes the traditional New Keynesian model and replaces the IS curve with a richer household sector that better reflects the empirically founded theory of consumer behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Household sector\n",
    "\n",
    "Households in HANK consume and supply labour, and face two key margins: (1) to consume or save in liquid assets and (2) the portfolio choice between liquid and illiquid assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The household sector is set up to endogenise an empirically realistic distribution of marginal propensities consume (MPC) and household wealth. This is achieved through two channels: (1) idiosyncratic labour productivity ($z$) and (2) allow households to hold varying portfolios of liquid ($a$) and illiquid ($b$) assets. Endogenizing these characteristics produces three types of households in the model: \n",
    "- classic 'wealthy' households that holds both liquid and illiquid wealth \n",
    "- poor 'hand-to-mouth' households that hold no liquid or illiquid wealth\n",
    "- wealthy 'hand-to-mouth' households that hold no liquid wealth but a lot of illiquid wealth \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'hand-to-mouth' households account for around 30 per cent of the total population and introduce constraints that mean Ricardian equivalence holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each time period $t$ the state of the economy is determined by the joint distribution $\\mu_t (da, db, dz)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "HANK captures death through an exogenous Poisson intensity $\\zeta$ where at the end of the lifecycle, all wealth is distributed to other individuals in the economy proportionate to their existing asset holdings. The individual is replaced with a new, zero wealth, individual with randomly drawn labour productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Household utility\n",
    "\n",
    "A representative household consumes and supplies labour with preferences over utility from consumption ($c_t \\geq 0$) and disutility from working ($\\mathscr{l}_t \\in [0,1]$). Utility $u$ is strictly increasing and concave in consumption and strictly decreasing and concave in hours worked. Preferences are conditional on an individual surviving ($\\zeta$) where the future is discounted at rate $\\rho \\geq 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_0 \\int_{0}^\\infty e^{-(\\rho + \\zeta)t} u_(c_t, \\mathscr{l}_t)dt\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Households maximise their expected utility subject to a number of budget constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Household budget constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Household asset holdings and their second marginal choice between liquid and illiquid assets evolve according to three key functions: (1) liquid assets, (2) kinked transaction cost function and (3) illiquid assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Budget constraint 1: Savings in liquid assets $\\dot{b}_t$**\n",
    "\n",
    "Households can borrow in liquid assets up to some exogenous limit at the real interest rate $r^{-b}_t = r^b_t + \\kappa$ where $\\kappa>0$ represents an exogenous wedge between borrowing and lending rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{b}_t$ increases with household income from labour, investments and government benefits and falls with household income diverted towards investments and consumption expenditure. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{b}_t = (1 - \\tau_t)w_t z_t \\mathscr{l}_t + r^b_t(b_t) b_t + T_t - d_t - \\chi (d_t, a_t) - c_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- the first term equals the income from labour $w_t$ less income tax $\\tau_t$. Wages are also adjusted for the household's idiosyncratic labour productivity $z_t$ and their preference for leisure (i.e. disutility of working) $\\mathscr{l}_t$. \n",
    "- the second term captures interest earnings on liquid assets \n",
    "- $T_t$ represents government transfers/payments\n",
    "- $d_t$ is the money directed to illiquid account $\\dot{a}_t$\n",
    "- $\\chi(d_t, a_t)$ represents a kinked transaction cost function with functional form $\\chi_t|d| + \\chi_1|\\frac{d}{a}|^{x_2}a$ which ensure that costs jump discontinuously to strictly positive numbers thereby creating inaction in households\n",
    "- $c_t$ is the household's consumption expenditure\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The liquidity constaint\n",
    "It is important to note that the heterogenity of households (beyond the stochastic earning potential) and the mechnaism underpinning the model is largely driven by this quadratic cost function. The function takes a distinctive \"v\" shape, and drives households (whether wealthy or not) to effectively have very low wealth. This secondary drag (beyond the Calvo- pricing mechanism) is what drives behaviour through the model, consequentially raising the importance of the wealth effects and also creating the model behaviours which map to real-world observations. The importance of this aspect cannot be understated. It is addressed both as a critique of the microfoundations of the model and as a driver of effect, below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Budget constraint 2: Net savings in illiquid assets $\\dot{a}_t$**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{a}_t$ is calculated as interest earned from assets plus the net deposit from the household's liquid account $\\dot{b}_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    " \\dot{a}_t = r^a_t a_t + d_t \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $r^a_t$ is the return on illiquid assets where in equilibrium, as a result of the transaction cost, is always greater than the real return on liquid assets where $r^b_t > r^b_t$\n",
    "- $a_t$ is the level of illiquid assets \n",
    "- $d_t$ is hte money directed to illiquid assets from a household's liquid account\n",
    "\n",
    "Households can invest illiquid savings into capital $k_t$ and equity shares of intermediate firms that give a claim to the future stream of monopoly profits net price adjustment costs. There is no cost to households for shifting between these two assets so a no-arbitrage condition holds such that the return on equity equals the return on capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Household recursive problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steady state, the household recursive solution consists of decision rules for consumption, deposits and labour supply that determine optimal levels of liquid and illiquid assets: consumption $c(a, b, z; \\Gamma)$, deposits $d(a, b, z; \\Gamma)$ and labour supply $\\mathscr{l}(a, b, z; \\Gamma)$; where $\\Gamma:= (r^b, r^a, w, \\tau, T)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These optimal levels of liquid and illiquid assets together with the stochastic labour productivity process for $z$ induce a stationary joint distribution for illiquid assets, liquid assets and labour income $\\mu(da, db, dz; \\Gamma)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hand-to-mouth households \n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of the kinked price adjustment cost, the asset structure, the wedge between borrowing an saving and the labour income risks introduced above allow for a cohort of constrained households. These 'hand-to-mouth' households give way to a more realistic distribution of wealth and MPC in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Producers\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses the traditional New Keynesian structure with Final-Goods producers aggregating a continuum of inputs produced by Intermediate Goods producers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intermediate Goods Producers\n",
    "Monopolistically competitive firms produce intermediate good $j$ by renting capital inputs $k_{j, t}$ at rate $r^k_t$ and labour $n_{j, t}$ at wage $w$ from households using the production function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y_{j, t} = k^\\alpha_{j, t} n^{1-\\alpha}_{j, t}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms cost minimise and face the same marginal cost where factor prices equal their marginal revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firms choose prices $\\{p_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}$ to maximise profits subject to a quadratic adjustment cost function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-\\int_0^t r^a_s ds} \\Big\\{\\tilde{\\Pi}_t (p_t) - \\Theta_t \\frac{\\dot{p_t}}{p_t} \\Big\\} dt\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where: $\\tilde{\\Pi}_t (p_t) = (\\frac{p_t}{P_t} - m_t)(\\frac{p_t}{P_t})^{- \\epsilon}Yt$ represents profits prior to price adjustment costs, and $\\Theta_t \\frac{\\dot{p_t}}{p_t} = \\frac{\\theta}{2} (\\frac{\\dot{p_t}}{p_t})^2Yt$ is the quadratic Rotemburg cost of price adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final-Goods producers\n",
    "A competitive representative final-goods producer aggregates a intermediate inputs indexed by $j \\in [0.1]$: $Y_t = \\Big(\\int_{0}^1 y_{j,t}^{\\frac{\\epsilon - 1}{\\epsilon}} dj \\Big)^{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon - 1}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Government sector\n",
    "\n",
    "The government sector faces exogenously determined expenditure $(G_t)$ and administers taxes $(\\tau_t)$ and transfers $(T_t)$ on household labour income $w_tz\\mathscr{l}_t$. Revenue is also raised through bonds $(B_t^g)$ that are subject to interest rate $r^b_t$. The Government's intertemporal budget contraint is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\dot{B}_t^g + G_t + T_T = \\tau_t \\int w_t z \\mathscr{l}_t (a, b, z) d \\mu_t + r^b_t B^g_t\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "When the montetary authority adjusts the interest rate, the cost of raising revent $B^g_t$ changes resulting in a budget imbalance. Outside of the steady state, the fiscal instruments that Government can use to adjust and balance the budget include: $\\tau_t, T_t,$ and $G_t$. Given Ricardian equivalence no longer holds under constrained households, the choice of fiscal instrument can have significant implications for transmission mechanisms and size of impact from monetary policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monetary authority\n",
    "\n",
    "HANK assumes the monetary authority determines the real interest $r^b_t$  rate by setting the nominal interest rate $i_t$ on liquid assets according to the Taylor rule, consistent with the Fisher equation:\n",
    "$i_t = \\bar{r}^b + \\phi \\pi_t + \\epsilon_t$ where $r^b_t = i_t - \\pi_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors chose a Taylor rule explicitly to follow the New Keynsian model tradition. As noted in the summary, the intention of the paper is to make a clear comparison to existing RANK literature. They even intentionally choose a $phi$ value of 1.25 as it is commonly used in the literature. In this regard, the choice to have as few changes as possible to highlight the impact of the illiquid asset makes a lot of sense.\n",
    "### Equilibrium conditions\n",
    "The HANK model is fundamentally a general equilibrium model. That is, in the steady-state, all market clear. Specifically, equilibrium occurs in the HANK model where:\n",
    "- The liquid asset market clears where the outstanding stock of government debt is equal to the total household holdings of liquid bonds: $∫bdμ_t+B_t^g=0$\n",
    "- The total kaptial, plus equity in monopolistic producers is equal to the household’s holdings of illiquid assets: $K_t+q_t=∫adμ_t$\n",
    "- Labour demand equals labour supply rom households: $N_t=∫z\\mathscr{l}_t (a,b,z)dμ_t$, and\n",
    "- General goods markets clear: $Y_t=C_t+I_t+G_t+Θ_t+χ_t+κ\\bullet max ∫⁡\\{-b,0\\} dμ_t$ where the last three variables represent liquidation, transaction and borrowing costs (between 0 and $b$).\n",
    "Where $μ_t$ is the joint distribution of the household wealth $\\{da,db,dz\\}$. The integral form derives from the continuous time solution, addressed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous time modelling\n",
    "Unlike the other models taught in Macroeconomic Theory, the model in Monetary Policy According to HANK is built in continuous time. The choice is practical rather than material. In the words of Benjamin Moll, the author: \n",
    "\n",
    "> …it’s in continuous time; and for no reason except it’s going to make things easier to solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "— Benjamin Moll, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "We address the basis of this modelling approach for its novelty in relation to other discrete-time models and as it assists in delivering a model solution. Naturally, whether the model is built in discrete or continuous time, the economic interpretation and intuitions remain the same.\n",
    "The paper lists three advantages of using continuous time in the model:\n",
    "1. Borrowing constraints only appear in boundary conditions – that is, borrowing constraints only hold with equality at the boundary, they do not appear as inequalities for internal solutions.\n",
    "2. The first order conditions are ‘static’ — in that there is only the current period — and can be analysed by hand, and\n",
    "3. Matrix operations are quicker, relying on a sparse triangle matrix – because the dynamic component in the solution (an $N×N$ transition matrix, giving step-forward or step back transition) is a beefy — for want of a better term, where there is a prior state, current state, and future state along the diagonal and adjacent elements —  diagonal matrix, with which some software has fast algorithms for handling. Or so we are told.\n",
    "To this, we note two other advantages:\n",
    "4. The continuous time approach neatly deals with changes in the distribution of state variables (such as wealth of heterogenous agents, $μ_t$) over time.\n",
    "5. The viscosity solution — inspried by the real world physical system problem of movements in viscous fluids — to continuous time optimal decision-making problems neatly deals with kinks (not necessarily an issue with this model).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bridging the gap to continuous time formulations\n",
    "A continuous time formulation can only really be posed in the language of differential equations. The steps required, therefore is to — first — posed the Bellman as a differential equation, then — second — deal with the prickly question of treating stochastic Markovian processes in continuous time. Fortunately, these two steps are highly related in the solution.\n",
    "To develop the Bellman equation into the more prestigiously titled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation a discount factor $(β(Δ)=e^{-ρΔ})$ is inserted into the discrete-time Bellman equation, which is then reworked and then the taken as $Δ→0$ which yields the HJB form:\n",
    "$$ \\rho v(x) = max_{\\alpha \\in A} \\{r(x,\\alpha) + v' (x) \\bullet f(x,\\alpha)\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step involves reinterpreting the step-wise Markovian process into a continuous time differential equation $dx=μ(x)dt+σ(x)dW$, which is termed a diffusion process. Teh thrust of this idea is it tracks a distribution of a stochastic process over time rather than an individual realisation. In the case of the HANK model, they use a partial differential equation called the Kolmogorov Forward Equation with the form: \n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial g(x,t)}{\\partial t}=-\\sum \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [\\mu(x) g(x,t)]+ \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i \\sum_j \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}[\\sigma_(i,j)^2 (x)g(x,t)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solving the system\n",
    "The model is solved by solving the twin partial differential equations HJB and Kolmogorov Forward Equations. Because of the tight link between the two PDE, once the HJB is solved, the Kolmogorov Forward Equation is effectively given.\n",
    "Somewhat counter-intuitively, continuous time modelling does not work with computers, and therefore must be discretized. However, there are a number of methods for computing PDE. This paper uses the finite differences method, which involves linearising the PDEs on a tight discrete grid and solving numerically. The discretized matrix is very sparse, being scarcely larger than a diagonal matrix which makes it very efficient for handling computationally. Further, the transpose of the discretized HJB (the $A$ in $ρv=u(v)+A(v)v$) is the discretized Kolmogorov Forward Equation.\n",
    "Solving the system requires the following algorithm:\n",
    "1. Given the sectors described above, solve the HJB equations using a finite difference method for the liquid, illiquid and labour. Calculate the associated savings policy functions $s^\\mathscr{l} (a)$, $s^\\mathscr{l} (b)$ and $s^\\mathscr{l} (z)$.\n",
    "2. Given each of these savings functions solve the joint distribution Kolmogorov Forward Equations using the finite difference method $g^\\mathscr{l} (a)$, $g^\\mathscr{l} (b)$ and $g^\\mathscr{l} (z)$.\n",
    "3. From these HJB, solve the savings equations backward from the stead state conditions.\n",
    "4. From these Kolmogorov Forward Equations, solve dispersion functions forward through time.\n",
    "5. Solve the market clearing conditions given both of these PDE at each time to generate the transition dynamics (which characterise the movement from initial conditions (or shock) to the steady state conditions)."

    "## Economic interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct and indirect effects of a monetary shock on household consumption\n",
    "The importance of indirect effects — as a result of liquidity costs — is the primary results of the paper. Compared with RANK models, transmission of the HANK model is almost entirely through indirect (wealth) effects; in the ratio of up to 9:1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism is of direct effects are highest for households close to the borrowing constraint, and decline to zero for households with no liquid wealth, and as liquid wealth grows, increase until the direct elasticity peaks just below a value of 2. Beyond a sufficiently high level of liquid wealth, direct effects start to slowly decline. Direct effects are positive for borrowers and higher for households close to their borrowing constraint, because an expansionary monetary shock creates an income effect through lower interest payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indirect effects are very large for households with zero liquid wealth, meaning the presence of hand-to-mouth households is a key determinant for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in HANK. Hand-to-mouth households can be either entirely poor, or can have high levels of illiquid wealth but act poor. It is important to note that while the wealthy hand-to-mouth is counter-intuitive, it is readily observed in the empirical data and is part of the motivation of the model. In contemporary society, we can imagine the home-owner pensioner as an example, with a high level of illiquid wealth in their family home, but with low levels of liquid wealth. In a property-wealth-based society, as Australia is increasingly becoming, the archetype is more prescient than ever before.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hand-to-mouth response respond sharply to changes in both labour income and government transfers that occur in equilibrium after a monetary shock. An expansionary monetary shock causes labour income to rise by increasing demand for final goods. The shock also causes government transfers to rise because interest payments on government debt fall, and the rise in aggregate income also increases tax receipts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The role of two assets and household micro-heterogeneity\n",
    "The existence of two assets for households to hold (liquid and illiquid) allows the HANK model to match both the high aggregate wealth-to-output ratios and high MPCs observed in the data. A one-asset HANK model can only achieve one of those features at a time. The authors explored a calibrated one-asset (liquid asset) HANK model with a high discount rate which produced high MPC and similar elasticities to the two-asset HANK model. They found that since the model abstracts from capital by removing the illiquid asset, it ignores the price (equity returns) and quantity (investment) responses to monetary policy - an important transmission mechanism not to be overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another consideration of household micro-heterogeneity was how households compare to the \"spenders\" and \"savers\" in the Two-agent New-Keynesian model (TANK). In TANK, spenders consume their full income every period and so they are arguably similar to a hand-to-mouth consumer in HANK. The consumption of savers in TANK is highly responsive to interest rate changes through intertemporal substitution, which is not a behaviour that occurs within HANK since households have additional things to worry about such as future income shocks or liquidity constraints. The total consumption elasticity in HANK was larger than in TANK, however the direct elasticity in TANK was about 3 times larger (due to the savers in the model). Despite this high direct elasticity, the very small MPC of savers in TANK meant that the negative income effect (on savers) in TANK is weaker than in HANK.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The role of the fiscal response to a monetary shock\n",
    "Looking at scenarios for fiscal responses to the monetary shock, a baseline case is constructed in which government expenditures and debt are held constant and transfers adjust to balance the government budget constraint. The authors include a series of scenarios for two reasons: \n",
    "1. To show that the effects are not only attributable to fiscal impacts, and\n",
    "2. To highlight that monetary policy must consider fiscal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "They model several fiscal responses to monetary policy:\n",
    "-\tWhen instead government expenditures adjust, the overall impact of monetary policy on aggregate output is stronger, since when transfers adjust (in the base case) only the high MPC households increase consumption, and the conversion of transfers into consumption is not 1:1. The bulk of indirect effects here are accounted for by higher labour income rather than a combination of labour income and transfers.\n",
    "-\tWhen the tax rate adjusts, on the one hand the lower tax rate expands labour supply, while on the other hand lowering taxes is less redistributive than more generous lump-sum transfers and, thus spurs a smaller demand for private consumption. Results here are similar to the base case.\n",
    "-\tIn the case where government debt absorbs the majority of the fiscal imbalance in the short run, the lack of additional stimulus (through either expenditure or transfers) to aggregate demand does not increase labour income by as much as in the previous cases, and indirect effects account for a smaller share of the total (60% compared to 80% in the two previous scenarios). As a result, when government debt absorbs the slack, the monetary shock has a much smaller impact on the economy, roughly one-half of the baseline value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs between size and persistence, and between inflation and output\n",
    "The RANK model does not exhibit a trade-off between size and persistence of a shock, it is neutral to the timing of monetary policy. In HANK, a persistent shock results in the increased government transfers also being spread out over time, since interest savings on government debt are spread out over time. This reduced intensity of government transfers caused a reduced consumption response from hand-to-mouth households in each time period, leading to the cumulative consumption elasticity being much lower in HANK. As a result, highly persistent (or spread out) interest rate cuts are much less potent than sharp, but transitory ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inflation-activity trade-off in HANK is similar to that in RANK, as the inflation-activity relationship is largely determined by the Phillips curve and Taylor rule, which are the same in RANK and HANK. This trade-off is, however, sensitive to the fiscal policy response - which should be expected given what we have learned about how consumption responds to fiscal policy.\n",
    "- The elasticity of consumption in HANK under the case where transfers adjust (the base case from earlier) is higher than in RANK. This means that the same expansionary policy shock generates more inflation and a larger output gap in HANK.\n",
    "- In the case where a more passive fiscal policy approach is taken (government debt adjusts), we saw earlier that this resulted in a weaker indirect effect on consumption through labour income. This fiscal policy approach was found to be associated with a flatter inflation-output trade off than in the base case and in RANK.\n"

    "\n",
    "As with the representative agent New-Keynesian model we saw in class, HANK is designed to exhibit sticky prices by imposing a cost adjustment mechanism onto the firm – in this case, HANK uses the Rottenberg Quadratic cost adjustment model. This imputed sticky prices mechanism has no foundation in firm theory, and thus does not explain how firms actually determine their prices. This is important, because it’s this sticky prices notion that drives the non-neutrality of monetary policy in an NK model.\n",

    "Furthermore, since this sticky price mechanism is not micro-founded, this model is subject to the Lucas critique: that it is important to microfound a model so that structural changes in the economy can be accounted for, as they may change the entire paradigm by which the economy works. A notable example of such a structural change is the change in the slope of the Phillips curve over the past 60 or so years that Robert Lucas discussed in his Nobel Lecture on Monetary Neutrality (Lucas, 1996). A change in this relationship means a fundamental change between inflation and unemployment in the economy – a non-trivial change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements to this kind of model could come through micro-founding the firms and stick prices mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rottenberg (quadratic) pricing mechanism comes with caveats when trying to relate modelled price stickiness with both the frequency and amplitude of price changes observed in the data. Wright et al. (2011) suggest that the Rottenberg Quadratic cost adjustment mechanism fails to match the frequency of price changes under inflation. Wright et al. (2011) also showed that it is unnecessary to introduce cost adjustment restrictions such as Calvo- or Rottenberg-mechanisms to generate price stickiness in NK models, as they created a setting using search theory which still resulted in sticky prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wright et al.'s approach also included money in the model (as it was done in a New Monetarist framework), and monetary policy was neutral by design. NK models rely on sticky prices to generate equilibrium price dispersion, which is the root of monetary policy non-neutrality. In this New Monetarist setting, it is shown that  price dispersion can be achieved using a micro-founded model for monopolistic competition with search theory from Burdett and Judd (1983).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the HANK model is  focused on the macroeconomic effects of conventional monetary policy, i.e. shocks to the Taylor rule in economies that are far from the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Wright et al. (2011) made price dispersion possible in zero- or low-inflation settings, something which they suggest isn't possible in New-Keynesian models.\n",
